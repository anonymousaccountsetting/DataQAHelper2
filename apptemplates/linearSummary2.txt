The R-squared for the {{modelname}} has a value of {{r2 | round(3)}}.
{% if r2 < 0.3 -%}
Thus, the relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable is nonexistent or very weak.
You should not trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
{% elif r2 < 0.5 and r2 > 0.3 -%}
So, the relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable is weak or low.
You might not use the analysis provided to make inferences.
{% elif r2 < 0.7 and r2 > 0.5 -%}
So, the relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable is moderate.
You could trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
{% else -%}
So, there is a strong relationship between the chosen independent variable and the dependent variable.
You can trust the analysis provided to make inferences.
